# Branching Workflow Examples
## Feature Branch Workflow
### 1. Create a feature branch:
    git checkout -b feature-xyz
### 2. Work on the feature:
<!-- edit some files, develop the feature -->
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
### 3. Merge the feature branch back to main:
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-xyz
### 4. Delete the feature branch:
    git branch -d feature-xyz
